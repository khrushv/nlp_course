    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Which API?__ You are free to use any publicly available API for general LM -- as long as it's __not a chat assistant__. So, gpt 3.5 is fine, but chatGPT is not. Here's a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLOOM API - [bigscience/bloom](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) (on the right; recommended)\n",
    "- OpenAI API (via VPN) - [openai.com/api](https://openai.com/api/)\n",
    "- AI21 Jurrasic API - [ai21.com](https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-ai21-studio-and-jurassic-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "These APIs may require you to create a (free) account on their platform. Please note that some APIs also have paid subscriptions. __You do not need to pay them__, this assignment was designed to be solved using free-tier subscriptions. If no APIs work for you, you can also solve these tasks with the 6.7B model that you will find later in this notebook - but this will make the tasks somewhat harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Quests:__ you will need to solve 4 problems. For each one, please attach a short __description__ of your solution and a __screenshot__ from the API you use. _[If you use python APIs, show your python code with outputs]_\n",

    "| Strategy | Description | Pros & Cons |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Greedy Search | Chooses the word with the highest probability as the next word in the sequence. | **Pros:** Simple and fast. <br> **Cons:** Can lead to repetitive and incoherent text. |\n",
    "| Sampling with Temperature | Introduces randomness in the word selection. A higher temperature leads to more randomness. | **Pros:** Allows exploration and diverse output. <br> **Cons:** Higher temperatures can lead to nonsensical outputs. |\n",
    "| Nucleus Sampling (Top-p Sampling) | Selects the next word from a truncated vocabulary, the \"nucleus\" of words that have a cumulative probability exceeding a pre-specified threshold (p). | **Pros:** Balances diversity and quality. <br> **Cons:** Setting an optimal 'p' can be tricky. |\n",
    "| Beam Search | Explores multiple hypotheses (sequences of words) at each step, and keeps the 'k' most likely, where 'k' is the beam width. | **Pros:** Produces more reliable results than greedy search. <br> **Cons:** Can lack diversity and lead to generic responses. |\n",
    "| Top-k Sampling | Randomly selects the next word from the top 'k' words with the highest probabilities. | **Pros:** Introduces randomness, increasing output diversity. <br> **Cons:** Random selection can sometimes lead to less coherent outputs. |\n",
    "| Length Normalization | Prevents the model from favoring shorter sequences by dividing the log probabilities by the sequence length raised to some power. | **Pros:** Makes longer and potentially more informative sequences more likely. <br> **Cons:** Tuning the normalization factor can be difficult. |\n",
    "| Stochastic Beam Search | Introduces randomness into the selection process of the 'k' hypotheses in beam search. | **Pros:** Increases diversity in the generated text. <br> **Cons:** The trade-off between diversity and quality can be tricky to manage. |\n",
    "| Decoding with Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) | Chooses the hypothesis (out of many) that minimizes expected loss under a loss function. | **Pros:** Optimizes the output according to a specific loss function. <br> **Cons:** Computationally more complex and requires a good loss function. |\n",

       "113  We want to know the minimum number of letters Amy will need to code the 10 different types of books. We can go through each answer choice and eliminate the ones that do not work.\\nA. We can eliminate answer choice (A) because 3 is not enough letters to make codes of both 1-letter and 2-letter combinations. For example, if we have only 3 letters, we can only make 3 different combinations: A, B, C; B, C, D; and A, B, D. If we want to create a single-letter code for the fourth type of book, we cannot.
